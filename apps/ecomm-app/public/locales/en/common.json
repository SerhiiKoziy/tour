    "onePiece": "One piece of advice we will give is that they will only cover losses or damages if you have official documentation. If your train is delayed or cancelled, they’ll want a letter from the train company. If your bag is lost or stolen, they’ll want a police report. Also, book your policy within 15 days of purchasing your travel."
